## Supported Versions
AgriCraft has releases for Minecraft versions 1.7.10 and onwards, status per Minecraft version is as follows:

| Version  | Notes
|----------|:----------
|![1.7.10] | One more release to end the 1.7.10 chapter will be done, fixing all bugs from the previous version.
|![1.8.9]  | The 1.8.9 branch was highly experimental and the rendering is one big hack. Don't expect anything.
|![1.9]    | Skipped 1.9, as it was an incredibly short-lived release.
|![1.10]   | Port in progress.

## Bug Reports [![bug]][bug-link]

However before reporting a bug please update to the latest version of the mod to see if it still persists.
If you want to post bug reports for older versions, make sure to tell me what version you are using and the version of Forge you are using.
