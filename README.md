## Supported Versions
AgriCraft has releases for Minecraft versions 1.7.10 and onwards, status per Minecraft version is as follows:

| Version  | Notes
|----------|:----------
|![1.7.10] | No more work will be done on 1.7.10 by [InfinityRaider](https://github.com/InfinityRaider) or [RlonRyan](https://github.com/InfinityRaider/AgriCraft/commits/master?author=RlonRyan), if you want to maintain 1.7.10, contact us on Discord
|![1.8.9]  | The 1.8.9 branch was highly experimental and the rendering is one big hack. Don't expect anything.
|![1.9]    | Skipped 1.9, as it was an incredibly short-lived release.
|![1.10]   | Port finished, but not moved out of alpha.
|![1.11]   | Skipped 1.11.
|![1.12]   | Port in progress.

Please report any and all bugs you might encounter while playing with this mod (this only applies to versions of Minecraft this mod is currently being developed for). Suggestions are also welcome.
However before reporting a bug please update to the latest version of the mod to see if it still persists.
If you want to post bug reports for older versions, make sure to tell me what version you are using and the version of Forge you are using.
