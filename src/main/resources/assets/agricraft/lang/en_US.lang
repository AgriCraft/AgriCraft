agricraft_journal.introduction=Welcome to Agricultural farming! Today I will teach you the basics of farming with crops. To start, you will need to put 4 sticks in a crafting grid; this will make crops. These can be put on farmland, and seeds can then be planted in them. You can also apply a second set of crops to an existing crop; this will create a cross-crop. If you plant two or more plants in crops adjacent to a cross-crop, there is a chance for a mutation to occur. In this journal you can keep track of all your discovered crop mutations. To register a discovered seed, put the journal in a Seed Analyzer and then analyze the seed. This will reveal to you the properties of the seed, as well as register it in this journal. If you ever wish to copy the journal, put it in a crafting grid together with a blank book and quill.
